This is solid, clean, simple work. 

All that desructuturing is cool. 

One thing about descructuring props and state. Sometimes it's nice to be able to see if a variable is on props or on state or defined locally. 

Without looking at where it's defined, "name" could be anything. "state.name" is clearly part of state.
